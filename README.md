# NeuroEvoCar
NeuroEvoCar is an implementation of a neuroevolution using JNEAT: an implementation
of NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies). This application uses JNEAT to 
teach a car to drive a track. I made this project for my high school final examination, 
I posted my theses which I written to explain what genetic algorithms and neuroevolution are
and what this project is all about:
